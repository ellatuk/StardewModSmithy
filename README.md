# StardewModSmithy

StardewModSmithy is a mod for creating content pack mods. This is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so that one can create mods without writing any JSON.

> [!TIP]
> Some features of this mod do not work well with mod managers (yes not even Stardrop)
> Direct install and launch is recommended

## How to use

This is an SMAPI mod and you have to install like a typical mod:
1. Install SMAPI
2. Install StardewUI
    * note: it's recommended though not required to use the [unofficial fork here](https://github.com/Mushymato/StardewUI/releases)
3. Install StardewModSmithy extracting the downloaded .zip file to your Mods folder

Once that is done, you should see a new button on the main menu. Clicking on it opens up the main workspace UI.

## Demo

See [demo/furniture.webm] for a quick demonstration of how the furniture UI works.

## Control Tips
- On spin boxes (the values with left and right arrows), you can scroll while mouse is over the value to quickly change values.
- You can pan, that is move around both bounds and sheet, by holding the left and right mouse buttons togther. The right mouse is a modifier key and can be changed.
- You can switch between bounds/sheet mods with middle click, this can be changed in config.

## What can you make?

The mods you can currently make using StardewModSmithy include
- Furniture (Content Patcher, with support for catalogues via MMAP)
- Wallpaper & Flooring (Content Patcher)

Hopefully this list expands as development continues.
